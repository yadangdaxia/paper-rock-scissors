# paper-rock-scissors

I am learning Javascript through Odin Project, and one of the exercises is to make a paper-rock-scissors game. This is the first iteration. The live demo is here:

Next steps: 
* Code needs to be refactored, cleaned up and put into functions. 
* A winner needs to be declared at some point and the user should have the option to play again.
